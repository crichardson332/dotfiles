  High level inference and reasoning
  - "A short survey" (2020) says 
  > Most of the existing systems, particularly question answering systems, are based on semantic matching i.e relevance between the previous context and the current question is calculated to answer the question, which makes the systems incapable of reasoning. 
  - What can we do to enable high level inference?

  - ConceptNet
    - Annoted solely based on first entity with no context
      - Could we add context?
      - Update knowledge graphs to include context?
